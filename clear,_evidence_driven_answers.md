Clear Evidence-Driven Answers

## **1\. What cell types did you identify?**

Clustering of the single-cell dataset revealed several distinct immune cell populations. Based on characteristic lineage markers and cluster-level enrichment scores, the following cell types were identified:

- Nuocytes (≈32.6%)  

- Natural killer (NK) cells (≈23.9%)  

- Gamma Delta (γδ) T cells (≈14.3%)  

- Neutrophils (≈8.3%)  

- Naive B cells (≈7.3%)  

- Plasma cells (≈5.5%)  

- Monocytes (≈5.4%)  

- Platelets (≈1.8%)  

- Thymocyte-like cells (≈0.8%)

## **2\. Explain the biological role of each cell type**

- Nuocytes: ILC2-related cells involved in type-2 cytokine production and tissue repair.  

- NK cells: Innate cytotoxic cells that target virally infected or malignant cells.  

- γδ T cells: Rapid-response T cells that recognize stress signals without classical antigen presentation.  

- Neutrophils: First-line phagocytes that dominate early antibacterial responses.  

- Naive B cells: Antigen-inexperienced B cells capable of entering differentiation pathways upon activation.  

- Plasma cells: Terminal B-cell derivatives that produce high levels of antibodies.  

- Monocytes: Circulating precursors of macrophages and dendritic cells with roles in phagocytosis and cytokine release.  

- Platelets: Megakaryocyte-derived cell fragments essential for clot formation.  

- Thymocyte-like cells: Immature T-cell populations typically seen in the thymus; likely represent annotation overlap rather than true thymic tissue.

## **3\. Is the tissue source really bone marrow? Justify your answer**

The overall cell composition is not consistent with classical bone marrow. Several features support this conclusion:

- Absence of major bone marrow compartments such as erythroid precursors, megakaryocyte progenitors, and early hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.  

- Unusually high representation of Nuocytes and NK cells, neither of which typically dominate bone marrow or peripheral blood to this degree.  

- Low neutrophil frequency, without the developmental gradient usually present in marrow samples.  

- Presence of thymocyte-like cells, suggesting annotation spillover rather than true tissue of origin.  

These findings indicate that the dataset is unlikely to represent intact bone marrow. Instead, it appears to be a lineage-skewed or selectively enriched immune sample, possibly influenced by technical or preparatory factors.

## **4\. Based on the relative abundance of cell types, is the patient healthy or infected?**

The dataset does not exhibit features expected in an infected or inflamed state. In typical infections, especially bacterial, neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes expand significantly. Here, both populations remain relatively low (neutrophils at ~8% and monocytes at ~5%). No strong transcriptional evidence of activation is observed.

While NK cells and γδ T cells are relatively abundant, such patterns can occur through sample enrichment and do not, by themselves, indicate infection. Overall, the immune landscape appears non-inflammatory, and the data more likely reflects technical enrichment rather than a biological response to infection.

# **Summary Conclusion**

The dataset shows distinct immune clusters but lacks the hallmark diversity of bone marrow. The dominance of ILC-like populations and minimal representation of progenitors argue against a marrow origin. Similarly, the distribution of immune cells provides no strong evidence for infection, instead suggesting selective recovery of certain lymphoid subsets.
